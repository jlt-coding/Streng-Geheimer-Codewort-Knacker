# Streng-Geheimer-Codewort-Knacker
Scripts recovered from a hidden top-secret Rudi Ratte hideout, busted by Tom Turbo in 2017.
The scripts were subsequently made available to JLTC by [redacted] and are under permanent control of Detektivb√ºro Tom Turbo ever since.

# Purpose
The apparent purpose of this script was to help Rudi Ratte gain acces to hidden Knabbernossi goodies by extracting the new Streng-Geheime-Codewort and submitting it while blocking all other incoming calls from other detectives. This would have effectively made him the best detective of all time, including him gaining the worlds biggest collection of Detektivurkunden and bringing despair to thousands of children all over the german-speaking region of europe.

# Concept
The idea behind this program was to collect all provided letters in every riddle of every episode of Tom Turbo, and afterwards generating a dictionary with all possible 5 word combinations.
After crossreferencing this with an existing dictionary of the german language, Rudi Ratte could have eliminated every word from his list of potential solutions that are not part of the german language, and submit every solution that was left over.
While other children would have needed to passionately focus on the case in order to help Tom Turbo solve it, he could have just sit back and let a machine do his work.
